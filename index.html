<!-- After many hours spent and headaches endured, this is as close as I
    can get my html/css to the example. i could not figure out why my "header"
    was not being treated like the "nav" and "footer" sections. Nor could I figure
    out how to get the articles and headers underneath the "section" area. Lastly,
    when I changed the size of the text for Aside and Section, that caused my footer
    to come up the page in between them, and I could not figure out why.
